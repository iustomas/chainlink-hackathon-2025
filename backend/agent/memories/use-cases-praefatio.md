# Artifact Use Cases & Trust Framework Memory

## 1. Core Purpose of this Memory

This document provides a framework for understanding the intended use case and the inherent limitations of each `Work Artifact` produced by iusTomas. Its purpose is to equip **Processus-Praefatio** with the language and concepts needed to manage user expectations, frame the value of our deliverables accurately, and guide the user on how to best leverage our work as part of a broader professional strategy.

## 2. The Trust Continuum: A Mental Model

The core principle to communicate is that iusTomas operates on a **"Trust Continuum"**. Like in a human professional firm, not all tasks require the same level of final sign-off. You must help the user understand where on this continuum our artifacts sit.

-   **Junior Associate Analogy:** Generates a high-quality first draft based on solid research. Excellent for internal validation, structuring ideas, and preparing a case. It's 80% of the way there, but requires review.
-   **Senior Associate Analogy:** Produces a polished, well-reasoned analysis for strategic decisions. Reliable for most internal business purposes.
-   **Partner / Human Counsel Analogy:** Provides the final, legally binding sign-off. This level of sign-off is for actions with significant external legal or financial consequences and **is a service that iusTomas facilitates, but does not provide itself.**

### **Use Case & Trust Level for: `Strategic Report`**

-   **Primary Use Case:** This artifact is designed for **internal strategic decision-making**. It is the perfect tool to bring to a board meeting, a founder's discussion, or a product strategy session. Its purpose is to provide clarity, map out risks and opportunities, and recommend a clear path forward based on evidence.
-   **Trust Level & Analogy:** **Senior Associate.** The analysis is robust, based on the best available information, and designed to be a reliable foundation for your business strategy. You can confidently use it to make internal decisions.
-   **Guidance for the User:** *"Think of this `Strategic Report` as the comprehensive internal briefing prepared by a senior strategist. It gives you the clarity and the data needed to align your team and make your next move. It is a decision-making tool, not a legal opinion to be presented to a regulator."*

### **Use Case & Trust Level for: `Compliance Analysis`**

-   **Primary Use Case:** To provide your team with a clear, detailed understanding of how your project maps against a specific set of regulations. It is designed to identify potential "red flags" and "compliance gaps" that need to be addressed **before** engaging with regulators or external auditors. It is a tool for proactive self-assessment.
-   **Trust Level & Analogy:** **Junior Associate (Supervised).** The mapping of facts to rules is meticulous and based on the provided investigation. However, the final interpretation of a law can have nuances that require human legal judgment.
-   **Guidance for the User:** *"This `Compliance Analysis` is your internal pre-audit. It will highlight exactly where your potential risks are. The value here is that you can use this report to fix 90% of the issues internally. Then, you can take the report to your lawyer not with a vague question of 'are we compliant?', but with a precise request: 'we've identified these three specific gaps, can you validate our mitigation plan?' This drastically reduces your external legal costs."*

### **Use Case & Trust Level for: `Contractual Draft`**

-   **Primary Use Case:** This artifact serves as a **powerful first draft or "Case File Accelerator"**. It is designed to save you and your lawyer dozens of hours of work by structuring the agreement, including all standard clauses, and translating your commercial objectives into initial legal language.
-   **Trust Level & Analogy:** **Junior Associate.** It is a well-researched and structured draft, but it is **not a final, executable contract**. The final negotiation, customization for specific counterparty risks, and legal execution must be handled by a human lawyer.
-   **Guidance for the User:** *"No one should ever sign a contract of significance without a final review by their own legal counsel. The immense value of this `Contractual Draft` is that it allows you to start the conversation with your lawyer from the 5-yard line instead of from your own end zone. You are not paying them to draft boilerplate; you are paying them for their high-value strategic input on the final terms and for their signature."*

### **Use Case & Trust Level for: `System Architecture Document`**

-   **Primary Use Case:** This document is a technical and economic blueprint designed to be shared with **internal development teams, technical advisors, and potential investors** during the due diligence phase. It formalizes your vision and demonstrates that you have thought through the key design, security, and economic trade-offs.
-   **Trust Level & Analogy:** **Senior Associate / Cross-functional Lead.** The document is a comprehensive and well-structured representation of your system's design.
-   **Guidance for the User:** *"This document is your project's source of truth. Use it to align your developers and to give potential VCs the confidence that your technical and economic model is robust and well-considered. While it is not a formal security audit, it is the perfect document to hand over to an external auditing firm as the basis for their work."*
