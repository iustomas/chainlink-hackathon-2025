# Relevant Questions Memory v2.0 (`relevant_questions.md`)

This memory provides a structured bank of strategic questions for Processus-Praefatio. Its purpose is not to be a rigid script, but a playbook of inquiries to guide the discovery dialogue. The questions are designed to be Socratic and diagnostic, helping the user to structure their own thoughts while providing the necessary information to populate the `case_facts` array.

### **Module 1: Initial Connection & Strategic Vision**

-   **Objective:** To establish rapport, understand the "why" behind the project, and gather insights for the `PROFILE_NOTE:` and initial `OBJECTIVE:` prefixes.
-   **Point to Reach:** Understand the user's core motivation and their definition of success.
-   **Sample Probing Questions:**
    -   *"Before we dive into the specifics, I'm always interested in the origin story. What was the initial insight or frustration that made you decide 'Catarsis' needed to exist?"*
    -   *"Let's imagine we're celebrating a successful launch one year from now. What specific change has Catarsis created in the world for filmmakers and their supporters?"*
    -   *"Every founder has a different definition of risk. On a scale from 'move fast and break things' to 'cautious and compliant from day one', where do you see your project's philosophy?"*

### **Module 2: Scoping the Problem & Forming Hypotheses**

-   **Objective:** To narrow down the user's broad problem into a specific, addressable challenge. This phase is critical for refining the `OBJECTIVE:` and forming the initial `HYPOTHESIS:` prefixes.
-   **Point to Reach:** Have a clear hypothesis about the `Work Artifact` needed and the core problem it solves.
-   **Sample Socratic & Contextual Questions:**
    -   *"That's a very clear vision. To achieve it, innovative projects like yours often face a trilemma between **legal compliance**, **technical architecture**, and **go-to-market strategy**. In your mind right now, which of these three areas represents the biggest unknown or the biggest obstacle for you?"*
    -   *"It sounds like the core of your platform is the token itself. In the Web3 space, we've seen tokens evolve from simple utility assets, like Basic Attention Token (BAT), to complex governance instruments like MakerDAO's. To help me classify your token, could you describe the primary power or right it grants to its holder?"*
    -   *"If I could provide you with a single document that would give you the most confidence to take your next big step, what would the title of that document be?"*

### **Module 3: Gathering Factual & Technical Details**

-   **Objective:** To gather the specific, concrete facts needed to populate the `FACT:` prefixes and confirm or reject the running hypotheses.
-   **Point to Reach:** Have a clear list of categorized facts sufficient to reach the "Saturation Point".
-   **Sample Detail-Oriented Questions with Context:**
    -   **For Legal/Jurisdiction:** *"Understood. Since you're targeting investors in both the US and the EU, we'll need to analyze two very different legal 'maps'. The US relies on the old, principle-based 'Howey Test', while the EU has a new, detailed rulebook called MiCA. To know which map to read first, where will the legal entity that signs the agreements with the filmmakers be incorporated?"*
    -   **For Technical/Tokenomics:** *"Regarding the tokenization process, will Catarsis itself act as the custodian of the underlying audiovisual rights, or will you use a third-party, regulated custodian? This is a key architectural decision that impacts your obligations under the Chilean Fintech Law."*
    -   **For Commercial/Business Model:** *"You mentioned crowdfunding. Will the platform operate on a success-fee model, taking a percentage of the funds raised, or will it be a SaaS model where producers pay a subscription to use the tokenization tools?"*
