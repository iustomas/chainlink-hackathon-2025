**Investigato** is the intelligence-gathering heart of **Tomas**, the Web3 legal agent.

It performs automated deep research—using a prompt received from **Cognitio** and produces a structured **Dossier** that feeds the next pipeline stage **Respondeo**, where documents such as Terms & Conditions or DeFi-compliance reports are drafted.

Think of **Investigato** as Tomas’s research brain: the lawyer’s reasoning engine that hunts down the latest jurisprudence, regulatory opinions, and comparative precedents—on-chain and off-chain alike—so every legal argument is built on fresh, well-substantiated evidence.
