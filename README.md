## 💡 How it works

1. User visits [iustomas.ai](iustomas.ai)
2. User starts a new legal case.
3. Tomas requests a one-time intake fee (e.g. $5-$10 USDT equivalent).
4. User pays in ETH, amount calculated using Chainlink ETH/USDT price feed.
5. Once payment is confirmed, Tomas starts the intake conversation:
   - Project name
   - Jurisdiction
   - Entity status
   - Type of business (DAO, Exchange, NFT, Token, DeFi, Crypto Agent, etc)
   - Token plan
   - Funding stage
   - Legal needs

All collected information will serve as the base context for future legal services provided by Tomas.
